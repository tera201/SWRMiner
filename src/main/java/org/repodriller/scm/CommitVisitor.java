 * A CommitVisitor visits Commits from an SCMRepository.

 *   - {@link CommitVisitor#process} all the Commits
 *   - {@link CommitVisitor#finalize} this SCMRepository
 *
 * Notes:
 *   1. If {@link org.repodriller.RepositoryMining#withThreads} is being used, then process() must be thread-safe.
 *   2. Multiple CommitVisitors may be operating concurrently on this SCMRepository.
 *   3. A CommitVisitor will only visit commits from one SCMRepository at a time.
 *   4. The SCMRepository passed to initialize() and finalize() will be the same.
 *      However, process() may receive different equivalent SCMRepository's.
